Playfair Display: fastn Font Typography Package

This repository contains a [fastn font typography package](https://fastn.com/featured/fonts-typography/) containing [Google Font: 
Playfair-Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display/about).

Playfair is a transitional design. In the European Enlightenment in the late
18th century, broad nib quills were replaced by pointed steel pens as the
popular writing tool of the day. Together with developments in printing
technology, ink, and paper making, it became to print letterforms of high
contrast and delicate hairlines that were increasingly detached from the
written letterforms.

Designers: Claus Eggers SÃ¸rensen
